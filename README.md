# Wordsmith
With the help of our Chrome extension, you can get the pronunciation, synonyms, antonyms, and an image of nouns with just one click!

## What It Does
Wordsmith is a Chrome extension that acts as a miniature dictionary for the user. The user will highlight a word or phrase and the Wordsmith icon will pop up for the user to click. Once the user clicks the icon, a small dictionary user interface will appear for the user. The interface includes:

* Pronunciation of the word
* If the word is a noun, adjective, or verb, and an image of the word if it is a noun
* The definition of the word or phrase
* Synonyms and antonyms of the word or phrase
* A "favourites" button that allows the user to add the word or phrase to a list that they can view later

## How to Use?
Highlight a word and click the extension.

## Inspiration
All the members of our team come from many cultural backgrounds. Due to this, we have seen many people we know struggle to understand the text as they read, especially if English is not their primary language. We were inspired to create Wordsmith to aid those with difficulties reading English such as new English learners and those with disabilities.
